    								<h4> Summary:</h4>
                                    <p>On September 7th, 2017, Apple held their annual special event where they announced new hardware and software. The special event began with the introduction of a new partnership between Apple Music and James Corden’s Carpool Karaoke and continued on the topic of entertainment with the announcement of Super Mario Run on the App Store. Apple discussed their new iOS, iOS 10, their updated iWork Suite and also mentioned their extension of Apple Pay to Japan. On the hardware note Apple announced: the new Apple Watches, Series 2, with partnerships with Nike, and Hermes; the new iPhones, iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus; and redesigned EarPods equipped with a lightning cable instead of the ancient 3.5mm cable, as well as their new wireless counterparts, AirPods.</p>
                                    <h4> Analysis:</h4>
        							<p>Apple’s recent special event can show all the different things that're going on in the world with computer engineering due to its presence as the biggest consumer electronic company. Apple is worth over $500 billion, and has sold over 700 million iPhones. This year's special event indicates: technology's increasing presence in entertainment and personal media; growth of technology in fitness; the consumers desire for the fastest device, a simple smooth high quality experience; also, the technological movement towards everything wireless.</p><p>
Computer engineering with modern technology has been involved in entertainment and has a large impact due to its major role in the production and delivery of content. Apple has increased their interest in the entertainment industry not only with physical development of their products to more efficiently deliver content but also to get involved with software and content delivery itself. Apple boasts having over 140 billion app downloads on the Apple App store, which represents a legitimate consumer base with an interest in apps and entertainment. Even in 2014, Apple acquired Beats music and replaced the music service migrating customers to their own music service, Apple Music. Apple’s new partnership with James Corden, the announcement of the new app Super Mario Run, and improvements to Apple music indicate the industry’s consistent involvement in entertainment. The new iPhone 7 and 7 Plus also have a newly designed stereo speaker system which contributes to the delivery of entertainment. The new iPhones also contribute to the growth of personal media with their newly improved cameras which were designed to satisfy the growing demand for better pictures.</p><p>
Apple also announced their new Apple Watch. Which had a variety of variations, one being a Nike edition. The Nike edition sported different watch faces and a more athletic band. The watch is certified to go 50 meters deep into water and still continue to function. Apple also developed a new algorithm to calculate calorie burning even while swimming. The waterproofing and new algorithm expand the watch’s customer base to swimmers and other athletes who worried about water resistance and inaccurate caloric calculations. All these improvements are signs of tech’s increasing role in fitness.</p><p>
Computer companies have been increasing the speeds of systems and the efficiency of chip architecture and Apple is no different. Apple’s new iOS and iWork suite is more efficient allowing the new A10 Fusion chip to accomplish even more than previously expected fulfilling consumer’s desire for simple fast software. Apple claims that their new A10 Fusion chip is 40% faster than its predecessor clocking the A10 fusion at about 2.59GHz. In perspective the A10 fusion chip is 240 times faster than the original iPhone; this shows how much more sophisticated chip architecture is becoming. Not only does the new chip boast ultra-fast speeds but a new design performance controller leads to the most efficient user experience. Computational power and efficiency is key for consumers who want a smooth speedy user experience. Apple also removed the ancient 3.5mm headphone jack which led to their EarPods to be lighting equipped which mean that consumers now get headphones that output digital audio (higher quality) rather than analog audio. These advancements indicate consumers desire for the fastest device and a simple fluid high quality experience.
In the 1880’s radio waves were discovered, and have evolved into many variants. Common basic uses of radio include walkie-talkies and FM/AM radio but more technologically advanced forms of radio include Digital Radio, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth. Apple has taken part in the movement for everything to become wireless with their introduction of AirPods, their take on wireless headphones. Their new wireless headphones feature a new embedded W1 chip, which is also used in Beats new line of earbuds (Beats X, Powerbeats 3, Solo 3 Wireless). The spread of the W1 chip and Bluetooth represent the growth of wireless technology.</p><p>
In the recent Apple Special Event many new devices and improved software was announced. The products announced were Apple’s latest innovations representing the direction their technology can and is taking. Apple’s dedication to Apple Music new partnerships and latest photographical innovations represent technology's increasing presence in entertainment and personal media. The new Apple watch is symbolic of the growth of embedded technology in fitness. The improved software and hardware are an answer to consumer’s desire for fast, simple, smooth, and high quality devices and experiences. AirPods are Apple’s response to the technological movement towards everything wireless. Apple’s presence as the biggest consumer electronic company reflect some of the changes and developments in computer engineering.</p>
